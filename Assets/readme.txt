1. Open the Prefabs folder, drag ball, door, player, and trigger into the scene.
2. If you want to use your own player prefab, just use the other three, and attach the throwAway script from the Scripts folder onto your own player prefab. When doing so, drag the diamond prefab into the sight slot of the script in the inspector to have a front sight when throwing a ball.
3. Make sure the camera you're using in the scene is the only game object tagged with "MainCamera"
4. Click the trigger object. You should see a script called Trigger Door Controller in the inspector. Drag the door object to "My Door," so the door and the trigger are linked.
5. Run the game
6. When you approach a ball, it should have red halo around it, which means it's ready to be picked up.
7. Press E to pick up the ball. Click left mouse to throw it away, or press E again to put it down.
8. When the ball hits a trigger, it should turn from red to green, and the door linked to it should be open.
9. Enjoy
